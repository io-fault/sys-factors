[ Current Working Context ]

The current working context is a (term)`Construction Context` selected for use with factor
processing instructions. The processing instructions use the abstraction layer to identify
the actual commands to run in order to acquire a product. Must like a user's current
working directory, it allows for focus to be managed.

/Commands
	/&.bin.cwctx
		View the current working context.
	/&.bin.chctx
		Change the current working context.

[ Current Working Factors ]

The set of factors that factor processing instructions apply to.

 - f +fault.system[scan cwd or designate path to pkg];
 - f -fault
 - f induct, construct.

[ System Contexts ]

The current working context and current working factors have to be recorded in some way
in order to recall them in subsequent commands.
Environment variables alone would work excepting that it may be desirable to share the
configuration across sessions, and that it may be desirable for the configuration
to be used across session restarts.

! PENDING:
	&..system.libcontext does not yet exist, and will be used to support cwx and cwf.
