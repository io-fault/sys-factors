The concepts described here are also defined briefly in terms. The sections here are offered for a
more detailed description with some rationale for their presence.

[ Factors ]

Factors are the primitives of projects. They are project targets that can consist of Fractions or be
Whole. Confusingly, Factors can contain Subfactors as well as Fractions. Metaphorically, it is similar
to a filesystem whose directories can contain files and have content.

[ Products ]

A Product is an arbitrary set of Factors. Products are rarely discussed directly as the focus is
usually on individual Factors and their respective build and type.

[ Construction Context ]

A Construction Context is a user defined adaption providing access to factor processing
tools that can perform builds. Contexts are used to perform Instantiation of a Product for use
in the target Environment.

[ Environments ]

Collection of &[Products].

[ Software Corpus ]

Collection of &[Products] created by an entity.
