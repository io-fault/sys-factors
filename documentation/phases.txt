Construction Contexts and the processing cycles dispatched by &..factors.

[ Construction Contexts ]

Construction Contexts are a lens used to perceive the way in which targets
are to be processed and used. They are selectable abstraction layers that
allow the developer to manage the builds for each platform that a set of
targets is being built for.

By using explicit abstraction layers, the entire processing sequence can be
modified to construct arbitrary outputs that reside alongside the usual
builds. Notably, the declarative approach used for defining target types
allows for context mechanisms that emit introspective information rather
than regular executables or libraries. This allows documentation to be extracted
without defining a custom rule for managing the extraction, and in a form
that is consistent with the targets constructed by the package.

The use of an abstraction layer allows the system to adapt to the developer,
rather than the developer being forced to adapt to the system.

================

At the conceptual level, a construction context is a single unit defining an
abstraction; in practice, there are variations that are used to manage the
purpose of a build. These variations usually inherit the core set of
abstractions, and define their own extensions to suite their
purpose--implicitly or explicitly.

A variant's explicit context extension is managed using a data structure that
is merged on top of the core data defining the abstraction. Implicit extensions
are usually an effect of the selected abstraction. That is, the rendered system
command implementing the processing instruction interally chooses different
options based on the variant.

================

The implementation of the concept in &..factors is internally viewed as
function taking a single parameter, the variants, that returns the unit
abstraction scanned for solutions.

[ Variants ]

A variant is a build parameter designated by the context or by the user. It
is separated from other build parameters as it changes the output of the
processing instructions used to construct a factor in such a way that
makes it desirable to separate it from other builds.

Variants can ultimately be arbitrary, but the common ones should help
illuminate the need and purpose:

	/Format
		The format of the output files that construct the target. Might
		not be referring to the actual binary format, but how they were built.
	/Intention
		The purpose of the build; debug, test, optimal. Controls
		optimization level, debugging symbols and code sections.
	/Context Name
		The context name; usually used by common environments to describe
		the origin of the context.
	/Dependency Specific Data
		System probes can influence the set of variants; notably,
		the Python implementation being built against allows concurrent
		builds to exist.

[ Conceptual Sequence of Events ]

Phases of the factor processing cycle:

	# &[Implementation] of the Factor Set.
	# &[Preparation] of the Factor Set.
	# &[Construction] of the Factor Set.
	# &[Materialization] of the Product from the Constructed Factor Set.
	# &[Incorporation] of the Materialized Product.
	# &[Validation] of the Inducted Product.
	# &[Installation] of the Inducted Product.
	# &[Deployment] of an Installation.

The first and last two events are not of direct interest to &..factors. For
some deployments, installation and deployment occur at incorporation.
Specifically, in that case, the product is being used in the place that
it was built. Implementation is the engineering process itself or metaphorically,
the process of getting the project sources in order to perform a build.

[ Implementation ]

This is the initial phase that is outside the scope of &.library. The implementation
of a factor is its authorship or creation. The exact meaning being irrelevant to
&.library.

[ Preparation ]

Preparation is the phase that is intended to occur after a set of unprocessed factors
is retrieved from a source code repository. In cases where factors, notably Composite,
are constructed from functions, a preparation hook can be used to generate the
necessary files.

[ Construction ]

Construction is the primary phase that &.library is concerned with. It uses the
aformentioned Construction Context's to process factors for the purpose of completing
a Product.

[ Materialization ]

Currently in &.library, materialization is purely imaginary. It's the step that follows
&[Construction] that may perform no operations.

! DEVELOPMENT: Plans
	Implement materialization as a step performed only after
	successfully constructing the entire factor set. May be a reasonable
	place to introduce post-processing of targets. (strip/isolate debugging)

[ Incorporation ]

Incorporation is the introduction of the materialized product, all of the factors, of a
particular construction context into use by the system. Notably, by the packages (directories)
that define the sources of the a particular factor set.

Incorporation allows &..system.libfactor to identify the set of resources that should be
used to facilitate the effect and function of a processed factor. It separates
construction from use to trivialize the identification of the constructed
factor's resources.

[ Validation ]

Validation is the final test. It performs the tests of a project against the inducted
factors for validation of its functionality in the final state. The tests ran by
validation would focus on integration testing as the interest is in whether or
not the given build works in the given environment.

[ Installation ]

The phase is which the inducted product is positioned for use on the system.

[ Deployment ]

The phase in which the installed product is put into use for a particular application.

[ Factor Processing Instructions ]

Construction Contexts are used to refer to a conceptual level.
Occasionally associated with some practical matters polluting the idea;
Factor Processing Instructions, however, are the renderings of a particular
context that are to be executed in order to materialize a product for
inductance.

When FPI is mentioned, it's usually in the context of an application of a construction
context.
