Introduction
============

`xeno` is a Python project providing import machinery for
automatic compilation of C, C++, and Objective-C extension modules.

"xeno" is referring to the foreign nature of the modules.

Requirements
============

A working Python interpreter and a working sysconfig module.

Conventions
===========

Nothing particularly strange.

Defense
=======

Working with extension modules in distutils is painful at best.
